1. Write a blog difference between documents and windows object

 Documents:
    * The document object is your html,aspx,php or other document yhat will be loadded into the browser.

    * The document actually gets loadded inside the window object and has properties available to it like
      title,Url,cookie and all properties related to DOM.

    * Some of the document object methods are: 
          # Window.document.getElementbyID()
          # Window.document.body.firstchild


 window object:
    * The windows is the first thing that gets loadded into the browser.

    * This window object has the majority of the properties like length,innerheight,name,open,close,
      moveto,resize etc.

    * Window is the global object. 

    * Some of the window object methods are 
         # window.open()
         # window.close()
         # window.moveto
         # window.resizeto()
